A Language Learning App
=======================

This is a generic Language Learning App.

## Structure
The app is divided to two root directories which are
essentially independent from each other. The purpose is to
separate the back-end logic from front end. 

## Installation

Clone the whole project 

```bash
# git clone https://github.com/damor4321/jlearning # optionally, specify the directory in which to clone
```bash

- The directory for the Backend is path/to/install/jlearning_back.

- The directory for the Frontend is path/to/install/jlearning_front.

Follow the README.md file instructions in those directories.
